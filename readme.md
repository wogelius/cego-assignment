## General info
This project generates a text file based on the contents of a MySQL-database, that is generated by a SQL-script.

The project consists of two parts:
* A Laravel cli app
* A MySQL database

These two parts are dockerized using Docker and Docker Compose.
When running the app using docker-compose, it launches a mysql-container that autoruns the sql-script located in the 'sqldump'-directory.
It then launches the app-container, which waits for the MySQL-container to be ready to accept connections. When the database is ready, the main script is launched as a Laravel command.
The command queries the database for all the users (200 at a time) and appends each of them as a line in a CSV-file generated in the 'output'-directory. If all goes well, it deletes the user from the database.

## Important directories and files
* /.env - Contains environment variables that are injected to docker-compose.yml
* /docker-compose.yml - Contains all the configuration for docker-compose
* /sqldump - All sql dumps located here will be run by the MySQL-container on startup
* /output/user_export.csv - The resulting csv-file will be located here
* /app - The directory containing the Laravel-app
* /app/Dockerfile - From this file, the Docker image of the Laravel app is generated
