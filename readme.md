## General info
This project generates a text file based on a sql-script

It consists of two parts:
* Laravel cli app
* MySQL database

These two parts are dockerized using Docker and Docker Compose.
When running the app using docker-compose, it launches a mysql-container that autoruns the sql-script located in the 'sqldump'-directory.
It then launces the app-container, which waits for the MySQL-container to be ready to accept connections, before it launches the Laravel-app.
The Laravel-app queries the database for all the users and writes each of them as a line in a CSV-file, which is
